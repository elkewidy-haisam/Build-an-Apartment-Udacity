Udacity Project 2 - Build an Apartment.

The globe will start to rotate about its center when you touch the phone screen.

The clock will read the hours, minutes, and seconds from local phone system and use it as a weighted percentage for rotating the corresponding
clock hand. The clock acts like an actual clock, operating in realtime.

Apartment was built using a combination of Udacity assets and assets imported from the Unity Asset Store.
